## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I have learned that I can use CSS and Grid together for laying out a design. I have come up with using Grid for multiple column designs and Flexbox for aligning designs in a single row or column.
